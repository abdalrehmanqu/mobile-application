# Digital Library (skeleton)

This is a small Dart project skeleton for an assignment. It contains:

- `assets/data` with example JSON files
- `lib/features/...` with domain entities, repositories, and utilities
- `bin/digital_library.dart` a small demo `main()` that reads the catalog JSON

How to run:

```bash
dart run bin/digital_library.dart
```

Notes:

- This is a minimal scaffold. Expand with more behaviour and tests as needed.
